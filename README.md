# Field Confidence Threshold Optimizer Tool
Kofax Transformation defaults to 80% as the default field confidence threshold. Finding the optimum threshold for each field is a tedious task.  
This tool
* visualizes true/false positives/negatives for thresholds 0%,5%,10%,15%,...90%,95% and 100%
* enables you to find the optimum threshold for each field.  
* helps you find the optimal configuration for each locator, evaluator, formatter, validation rule, and OCR profile.

| Color | Type | Correct | Valid | Human Action | 
| ----- | ---- | - | - | - |
|   游릭 | True Positive | Correct | Valid | - |
|   游댯 | False Negative | Correct | Invalid | Press ENTER |
|   游리 | True Negative | Incorrect | Invalid | Correct Text |
|   游댮 | False Positive | InCorrect | Valid | Lost trust in system |

Accuracy = 游릭+游댯. 
Human Effort = 游댯+游리. 
Errors = 游리+游댮. 

## Optimizing a Project
Unfortunately many think that the way to improve a KT project is to increase accuracy 游릭+游댯. This will not lead to success. Efforts that focus on Accuracy 游릭+游댯, ignore false positives 游댮 and don't focus on reducing human effort 游댯+游리.  

Accuracy cannot be converted into Time Savings, Cost Savings, FTE (Fulltime equivalent) reduction, ROI or productivity.  
Human effort 游댯+游리 can directly and accuractely be converted to Time Savings, Cost Savings, FTE (Fulltime equivalent) reduction, ROI or productivity. Therefore each project should focus on human effort 游댯+游리.

The two goals of every project should be
1. Reduce the number of errors 游댮 that humans are currently producing.
2. Reduce human effort 游댯+游리.  

The data comes from chart underneath. We can see that 82% is the lowest threshold that still gives 0% false positives 游댮.
| Confidence | TP | FN | TN | FP | Accuracy | Human Effort |  
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| | 游릭 | 游댯 | 游리 | 游댮 | 游릭+ 游댯 | 游댯+游리|
| 82% | 10.5% | 79.9% | 9.6% | 0.0% | 90.4% | 89.5% |
| 80% | 17.4% | 72.9% | 9.4% | 0.2% | 90.4% | 82.3% |

Reducing the threshold by 2% to 80% gives a false positive rate 游댮 of 0.2% (1 in 500) and a reduction in fields requiring human effort by 7.2 percentage points. It is always a game of compromise.

The following data shows that Accuracy metrics provide no value for productivity of a solution, nor do they help in anyway with optimizing the solution.  Notice that an accuracy of about 90% can have a  productivity gain between **1.4 and 2.8**, and clearly 2.8 is twice as good at 1.4!! 2.8 means that 1.8 people can be reassigned to other work - if an employee costs $100,000 /year, then this solution will save $180,000 / year. The next step is to see how the **productivity gain** can be improved even further.  
This is an example of how the **Field Confidence Threshold Optimizer Tool** can be used.

*This example uses **1 second** as the time to confirm a correct and invalid field 游댯, and **1.5 seconds** to enter the correct value of a incorrect field 游리.*

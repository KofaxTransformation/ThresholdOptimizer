# Field Confidence Threshold Optimizer Tool
Kofax Transformation defaults to 80% as the default field confidence threshold. Finding the optimum threshold for each field was a tedious task.  
This tool
* visualizes true/false positives/negatives for thresholds 0%,5%,10%,15%,...90%,95% and 100%
* enables you to find the optimum threshold for each field.  
* helps you find the optimal configuration for each locator, evaluator, formatter, validation rule, and OCR profile.

| Color | Type | Correct | Valid | Human Action | 
| ----- | ---- | - | - | - |
|   游릭 | True Positive | Correct | Valid | - |
|   游댯 | False Negative | Correct | Invalid | Press ENTER |
|   游리 | True Negative | Incorrect | Invalid | Correct Text |
|   游댮 | False Positive | InCorrect | Valid | Lost trust in system |

Accuracy = 游릭+游댯
Human Effort = 游댯+游리
Errors = 游리+游댮

## Optimizing a Project
Unfortunately many think that the way to improve a KT project is to increase accuracy 游릭+游댯. This will not lead to success. Efforts that focus on Accuracy 游릭+游댯, ignore false positives 游댮 and don't focus on reducing human effort 游댯+游리.  

Accuracy cannot be converted into Time Savings, Cost Savings, FTE (Fulltime equivalent) reduction, ROI or productivity.  
Human effort 游댯+游리 can directly and accuractely be converted to Time Savings, Cost Savings, FTE (Fulltime equivalent) reduction, ROI or productivity. Therefore each project should focus on human effort 游댯+游리.

The two goals of every project should be
1. Reduce the number of errors 游댮 that humans are currently producing.
2. Reduce human effort 游댯+游리.  

In the chart below you can see that the confidence threshold of 80% has a very false positive 游댮 rate, and a human effort rate 
| Confidence | TP | FN | TN | FP | Accuracy | Human Effort |  
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| | 游릭 | 游댯 | 游리 | 游댮 | 游릭+ 游댯 | 游댯+游리|
| 82% | 10.5% | 79.9% | 9.6% | 0.0% | 90.4% | 89.5% |
| 80% | 17.4% | 72.9% | 9.4% | 0.2% | 90.4% | 82.3% |
